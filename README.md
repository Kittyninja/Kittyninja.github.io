Welcome to Kittyninja's GitHub page!

I regularly post JS and HTML/CSS updates with tools for learning and just projects that I am working on.

# Current Projects
Right now I am working on JS tools for other devs and also a soccer table calculator (I call it football) and if you wish to use any of these tools and gadgets feel free to download the zip, or just browse and copy and paste. 

I am also working on a quiz that tells you your Minecraft class, found in the "minecraft-class-quiz" folder.

# Editing My Minecraft Quiz:
