# Kittyninja.github.io
Project Website

um this is just the beginnings of my github page...

I hope to put .js and .json files for storage and easy access with data for other projects.
I am still learning dom access with js loops and simulation/calculation.

Kittyninja.github.io is just html pages, I will put js on later.
