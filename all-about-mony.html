      <h1 class = "title"> ALL ABOUT MONY </h1>
      <p class = "p"> Mony is an old cat that lives in the Swanson house. She is frequently attacked and nipped at by the younger <a href = "file:///Users/chrisswanson/Documents/Louis.html">Louis</a>, though <a href = "file:///Users/chrisswanson/Documents/Monk.html">Monk</a>
        usually stays peaceful with her. She was a stray until the Swansons took her in in 2006 to become their pet. At 15 years old or so, she is the oldest and the wisest of the Swanson kitties. <br> <br>
